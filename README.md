# Tic_Tac_Toe
Standard tic toe with an option to enlarge the board 

works by using coordinates.

the option to change the size of the board is enabled by the use of vector of strings ( a 2D resizable array )

"checking to see if somebody won" methods are divided into 4 things, horizontal, vertical, 2 diagonals 

One problem that bugs me is checking function is quite hefty and in boards of huge size, it would take long time to just check.

the UI's Pretty clean ngl.
